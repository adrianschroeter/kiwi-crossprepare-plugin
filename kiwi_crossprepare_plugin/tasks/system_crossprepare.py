       kiwi-ng system crossprepare --target-arch=<arch> --init=<name> --target-dir=<directory>
           [--allow-existing-root]
       kiwi-ng system crossprepare help

commands:
    crossprepare
        prepare an image root tree for a cross architecture build process

options:
    --target-arch=<arch>
        name of image target architecture
    --init=<name>
        path to the image target architecture init program.
        The crossprepare plugin was created to support the qemu-binfmt
        concept to support calling cross-arch binaries. The preparation
        of an environment must be done by an independent host arch
        compatible binary which we call `init program` as it will be
        used as PID 1 program in the QEMU call from which binaries of
        the image architecture can be called. Neither kiwi nor this
        plugin are providers of the init sequence because this
        implements a custom initialization procedure which does not
        follow standards. From the plugin code the provided binary will
        be called and trusted to do the right thing.
    --target-dir=<directory>
        path to store the build results. The crossprepare command will
        initialize a new root directory at <directory>/build/image-root/
        which is compatible to how the kiwi build command does it.
        Therefore the specified --target-dir argument can also be
        used for a subsequent kiwi build command.
    --allow-existing-root
        allow to use an existing root directory from an earlier
        preparation attempt.
